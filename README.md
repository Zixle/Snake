# Snake

This project is a Turtle Graphics Simulation implemented in the C programming language. It allows users to control a virtual “turtle” on a 25x25 grid, issuing commands to move, turn, draw, or lift its pen. The simulation demonstrates foundational programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and modular function design while providing an interactive way to learn about procedural programming.
