# Snake

This project is a Turtle Graphics Simulation implemented in the C programming language. It allows users to control a virtual “turtle” on a 25x25 grid, issuing commands to move, turn, draw, or lift its pen. The simulation demonstrates foundational programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and modular function design while providing an interactive way to learn about procedural programming.

Features
	•	Pen Control:
	•	Pen Up (1): Stops drawing while the turtle moves.
	•	Pen Down (2): Enables drawing as the turtle moves.
	•	Turn Right (3): Changes the turtle’s direction clockwise.
	•	Turn Left (4): Changes the turtle’s direction counterclockwise.
	•	Print Grid (6): Displays the 25x25 grid, showing the turtle’s trail and current position.
